# Send CloudWatch Logs to Splunk via Kinesis Firehose

This module configures a Kinesis Firehose, sets up a subscription for a desired CloudWatch Log Group to the Firehose, and sends the log data to Splunk.  A Lambda function is required to transform the CloudWatch Log data from "CloudWatch compressed format" to a format compatible with Splunk.  This module takes care of configuring this Lambda function.

## Usage Instructions

In order to send this data to Splunk you will need to first obtain an HEC Token from your Splunk administrator.

Once you have received the token, you can proceed forward in creating a `module` resource, such as the one in the Example below.

You will use a KMS key of your choice to encrypt the token, as it is sensitive.  See `hec_token` input variable below for more information.

##### Example
```
module "kinesis_firehose" {
  source = "disney/kinesis-firehose-splunk/aws"
  aws_region = "us-east-1"
  arn_cloudwatch_logs_to_ship = "arn:aws:logs:us-east-1:<aws_account_number>:log-group:/test/test01:*"  
  name_cloudwatch_logs_to_ship = "/test/test01"
  hec_token = "<KMS_encrypted_token>"
  kms_key_arn = "arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:<aws_account_number:key/<kms_key_id>"
  hec_url = "<Splunk_Kinesis_ingest_URL>"
  s3_bucket_name = "mybucketname"
}

```
