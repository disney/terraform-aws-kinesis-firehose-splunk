# Change Log for Terraform AWS Kinesis Firehose Splunk

## v8.1.0
 * Change `var.name_cloudwatch_logs_to_ship` to be non-mandatory. It will now default to `null` and the subscription filter will not be created if it is `null`. See `var.cloudwatch_log_group_names_to_ship` to create subscription filters to multiple log groups.
 * Fix [#27](https://github.com/disney/terraform-aws-kinesis-firehose-splunk/issues/27) - Add `var.cloudwatch_log_group_names_to_ship` to allow creating subscription filters to multiple log groups.
 * Fix [#28](https://github.com/disney/terraform-aws-kinesis-firehose-splunk/issues/28) - Change `var.arn_cloudwatch_logs_to_ship` to be non-mandatory. The ARN will now be derived automatically if `var.name_cloudwatch_logs_to_ship` is used (not `null`).
 * Update README.md with variable changes, and a new description for `var.cloudwatch_logs_to_ship`.

## v8.0.0 - **Breaking Changes**

 * Updated `files\kinesis-firehose-cloudwatch-logs-processor.js` to latest version of AWS blueprint function code

 * Fix s3 bucket ownership with new resource `aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls`
 * Added `var.lambda_processing_buffer_interval_in_seconds`
 * Set default to `0.256` for `var.lambda_processing_buffer_size_in_mb`
 * Improved formatting of README.md

## 7.0.0
 * **Breaking Change** - Removed `var.kms_key_arn`
 * Update README.md with `terraform-docs`
 * Created Github actions pipelines
 * Support for SSE for the Kinesis Firehose
 * Added `reserved_concurrent_executions` parameter to Lambda function

 * Created NOTICE file
 * Fix [#19](https://github.com/disney/terraform-aws-kinesis-firehose-splunk/issues/18) - Support for S3 bucket Versioning, support for Object Locking, support for s3 bucket lifecycles
 * Fix [#18](https://github.com/disney/terraform-aws-kinesis-firehose-splunk/issues/18) - Allow the HEC token to be passed in via a new variable, `var.managed_hec_token`, allowing the user to encrypt it as they wish, perhaps via SSM Parameter Store or [SOPS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops)

## 6.0.0
 * Requires `>= 4.0.0` of the AWS provider; merged in [S3 changes](https://github.com/disney/terraform-aws-kinesis-firehose-splunk/pull/15)
 * Update README for the correct location of `aws_kms_secrets` usage example
 * Added `*.zip` to `.gitignore` file

## 5.1.2
 * Update license

## 5.1.1
 * Update description for `var.local_lambda_file`; it does not have to be a NodeJS file

## 5.1.0
  * Fix [#10](https://github.com/disney/terraform-aws-kinesis-firehose-splunk/issues/10) - Support custom Lambda script, as well as the `handler` for the custom code

## 5.0.3
  * Require `>= 3.58.0` of the aws provider (fixes issue with privisioning a NodeJS 12.x Lambda)

## 5.0.2
  * Update README with `region` variable in the example

## 5.0.1
  * Remove mention of `aws_region` input variable in README.md. This variable is no longer needed.

## 5.0.0
  * Require Terraform 1.0.0 or greater (drops support for versions lower than 1.0.0)
  * Fix [#7](https://github.com/disney/terraform-aws-kinesis-firehose-splunk/issues/7) - Remove provider block, which is also recommended by Terraform as discussed [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28580#issuecomment-831263879)

## 4.0.0 - Breaking Changes - (thanks [ShawnUCD](https://github.com/ShawnUCD))

  * Added `outputs.tf`

## 3.0.0 - Breaking Change - (thanks [phundisk](https://github.com/phundisk))

  * Adjust the module to be able to support for TF 13
  * Update to the README to add information on hec_token encryption_context and that s3_bucket_name is required
  * Add version lock to min AWS provider since the aws_s3_bucket resource region was always optional anyways
  * Add new resource aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block which can be enabled optionally via TF variable

## 2.0.0 - Potentially Breaking Change
  * Upgrade lambda to `node12.x` runtime (thanks [kevinkuszyk](https://github.com/kevinkuszyk))
  * Add latest javascript from the lambda blueprint (thanks [kevinkuszyk](https://github.com/kevinkuszyk))
  * Update README

## 1.0.0 - Breaking Change
